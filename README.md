## String Viewer

This project is a simple tool that allows the user to easily view information about any string they input.
I used C# for this project both because I wanted to work with C# and because there are some commonalities with Java.
This project challenged me in a major way. I found myself refreshing my math skills and writing pages and pages of notes.
As this was my first project using C#, I had to learn as I was developing.
I am very happy with how it turned out in the end, because I had a hard time and was discouraged many times.
Overall I am satisfied with how much I was able to learn by developing this project from start to finish.

#### Features i'd like to add:

 - Add the ability to handle non UTF-8 characters cleanly.
 - Add the ability to change the text to binary and binary to ascii.

#### Requirements:

- Windows 10

#### Project Installation

##### Windows 10:

This program requires Windows 10 to work, and has not yet been tested on any other versions of windows.
As such any errors relating to differing operating systems are not my concern until I test those specific operating systems.


##### Download the String-Viewer.exe file.

Installing the program is very simple due to how tightly integrated `C#` is with windows.
Download and run the `String-Viewer.exe` file.

##### Startup:

- Double click to run the `String-Viewer.exe` file.

#### How to use:

- `Type in` or `paste` a string of characters into the `text box` that says `Type Here to Begin...`.
- The graphs will react each time the text in the text box changes, and give the user information about the string.
- To reverse the order of the text click the `Flip` button.
- To remove all the symbols from the text click the `Drop Symbols` button.
- To change the letters within the `text box` to lower-case click the `Lowercase` button.
- To change the letter within the `text box` to upper-case click the `Uppercase` button.
